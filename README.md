Hello! 👋 I'm Ogtay, a passionate Front-End Developer based in Baku, Azerbaijan. 

<br/>
Since 2022, I have been building clean, easy-to-use websites and web apps — mostly focused on ERP systems. 🚀

<br/>
For the past 3 years, I’ve been working with React, Next.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and I continue to use them actively. I also build mobile apps using React Native. Recently, I’ve started working with Angular to expand my skills. 💻

<br/>
I’m always learning and keeping up with the latest web and mobile technologies. 🎯
Creating smooth and useful user experiences is what I enjoy most. 💡
